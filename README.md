# FinTrack — Finance Dashboard UI
---

## Overview

A modern frontend finance dashboard built with React, designed around real-world UX/UI patterns, thoughtful product decisions, and a strong focus on data usability. The application incorporates role-aware design principles to ensure tailored experiences for different user types.

It features a dual-theme system:

- A light theme with a warm orange–yellow gradient.
- A dark theme inspired by slate-toned glassmorphism, offering a sleek and focused interface.

The dashboard emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and intuitive data visualization, making complex financial information easy to interpret and act upon.

## Technical Decisions

**The data is generated, not hardcoded.** `generateTransactions.js` creates realistic Indian financial history on first load — with income-to-expense ratios, category distributions based on real spending ranges (₹8,000–₹20,000 for housing, ₹300–₹1,500 for food), and classified as recurring/non-recurring schedules based on users input. 

**Recurring transactions are first-class data.** Rather than a boolean flag, each recurring transaction carries its interval (`DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`) and a computed `nextRecurringDate`. This powers a hover tooltip that tells you exactly when the next payment hits.

**Role-based UI is applied at the component level.** Switching to `Admin` unlocks bulk selection, per-row action menus, delete confirmation flows, and the ability to add new transactions. The `User` role sees the same components with the mutation surface hidden — no fake routing, no hidden pages, just clean conditional rendering driven by context.

**Budget updates without a page reload.** Budget state lives in `AppContext` alongside transactions. When you edit the budget, `updateBudget()` sets state directly — the dashboard's `useMemo` watching `[transactions, budget]` recomputes immediately. No `window.location.reload()`, no stale data.

**Theme is a design decision, not just a toggle.** Light mode uses a warm orange-yellow gradient to feel personal and approachable. Dark mode switches to a glassmorphism slate palette with `backdrop-blur-xl` and translucent surfaces — because dark mode users have different aesthetic expectations, and applying the same colour palette in both directions is a missed opportunity.

## Features

### Dashboard
- **4 stat tiles** — Total Income, Total Expenses, Net Balance, Savings Rate — all computed live from stored transactions using `useMemo`
- **Balance overview chart** — running balance trend over time with a date range selector (7D / 1M / 3M / 6M / All Time)
- **Spending breakdown** — donut chart with a custom legend component that pins category names left and INR amounts right, properly aligned regardless of label length
- **Monthly budget tracker** — editable inline, colour-coded progress bar (green → yellow → red), contextually accurate captions at every threshold
- **Financial insights panel** — highest spending category, single largest expense, average daily spend, expense-to-income ratio

### Transaction Management

The transactions table is the core feature and received the most design attention.

- **Search** — matches both description and category simultaneously
- **Sorting** — click-to-sort on Date, Category, and Amount with direction indicators
- **Filtering** — composable: Type (Income / Expense) and Recurrence ( Recurring / Non-Recurring)
- **Recurring badge with tooltip** — the ones which are recurring transactions show their  interval as a badge specifying their interval; hovering reveals the exact next payment date computed from the transaction's interval and last occurrence
- **Admin controls** — per-row delete, row-level checkbox selection, bulk delete with confirmation, toast feedback on all mutations
- **Clear filters** — appears only when at least one filter is active

### Add Transaction (Admin only)
- Full modal with type toggle, description, amount, date, category, and recurring toggle
- Category options change dynamically based on selected type
- Frequency selector appears only when recurring is enabled
- Client-side validation with inline error messages
- Persists to `localStorage` immediately

### Role System
Toggle between `User` and `Admin` from the topbar. Role state lives in `AppContext` and is consumed directly by components that need it — no prop drilling, no routing guards.

### Theming
- **Light:** `from-slate-50 via-orange-100 to-yellow-50` — warm orange - yellow gradient theme
- **Dark:** `from-slate-900 via-slate-800 to-slate-900` with `backdrop-blur-xl` slate glassmorphism theme
- Preference persisted to `localStorage` and applied on load

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suhritareddy/fintrack-finance-dashboard.git
cd fintrack-finance-dashboardUI
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

On first load, 90 days of transactions are generated and saved to `localStorage`. To reset the data, clear `localStorage` in DevTools and refresh.

Use the **User / Admin** toggle in the topbar to switch roles.
